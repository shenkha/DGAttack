## Setup

1. **Clone the repository, navigate to the root directory, and install dependencies**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DGAttack
    cd DGAttack
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **(Optional) Set up a virtual environment**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
    ```


##  Train and Evaluate Dialogue Generation Models

We fine-tune pre-trained transformers like `facebook/bart-base` on dialogue datasets such as Blended Skill Talk (BST), ConvAI2, EmpatheticDialogues (ED), and Wizard of Wikipedia (WoW).

    
    python train_seq2seq.py \
        --model_name_or_path facebook/bart-base \
        --dataset blended_skill_talk \
        --output_dir results/bart-base
    
## Attack Models
You can reproduce the results in our paper by runing the following scripts, hyperparameters can be adjusted based on the papers:

1. **DGAttack**
    ```bash
    python attack_main.py  --model_name_or_path result/bart-base  --dataset blended_skill_talk  --out_dir logging/results
    ``` 

2. **Single-Objective GA**
    ```bash
    python attack_main_popop.py  --model_name_or_path result/bart-base  --dataset blended_skill_talk  --out_dir logging/results
    ``` 

3. **DGAttack LLMs**
    ```bash
    python attack_llm.py  --model_name_or_path google/gemma-2-9b-it  --dataset blended_skill_talk --out_dir logging/results 
    ```
